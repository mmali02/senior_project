# Senior project about gardening!

This project will be a website that allows students and future garden club presidents to look up and see what vegetables, fruits and native plants/flowers in Santa Barbara they can grow based on specific conditions. The elements that you can filter on are soil type, amount of sunlight, amount of water and time of year. Once you have filtered on different elements, there will be plants with their specific information about what time of year to plant them, their water usage, their sunlight needs, and what type of soil works best for them, as well as general information about the plant (such as spacing between planting seeds, size, etc.). As well as, I am hoping to create a form on the website that allows students to have a say in what vegetables the garden will be able to grow for the DC. 

## Motivation:
What inspired me to do this project was my interest in gardening and the ability to have a quick guide in order to plan for future gardening projects. I thought of creating a form that connects to the website, to further create connection between Westmont students and the garden. Because our garden helps grow some of the vegetables and as we are trying to become more sustainable, I thought it would be a great idea to involve the students in what vegetables they will see at the DC.

## Problem:
The problem I am trying to solve is creating an organized system that provides information to students about when to plant under different conditions. As well as creating a resource for future garden presidents that allows them to have a guide when planning for future gardening club events.

## Proposal:
My proposal is to create a cohesive website that contains information on vegetables, fruits and native plants/flowers from Santa Barbara in order to help relieve some of the pressure from future garden club presidents who may not have extra time to research during their busy schedules.
